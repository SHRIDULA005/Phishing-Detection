Phishing attacks remain one of the most persistent cybersecurity threats, exploiting human trust to steal credentials and financial information. Traditional blacklist and rule-based approaches fail to adapt against evolving phishing tactics, while existing deep learning methods often focus narrowly on either URL text or webpage visuals. This paper introduces a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–Vision Transformer (CNN–ViT) model that captures both local features (edges, URL patterns, and layout structures) and global context (visual semantics of webpages). The model is further designed for lightweight edge deployment, enabling real-time phishing detection on IoT and gateway devices. Experimental validation using benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed hybrid CNN–ViT achieves 97.5% accuracy, surpassing CNN-only and XGBoost baselines. Beyond accuracy, the model provides explainable detection through attention maps, increasing interpretability and trust. These contributions position our framework as a robust, scalable, and practical solution for modern phishing detection.
